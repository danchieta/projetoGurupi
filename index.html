	<p>A tool for image restoration from video frames using Bayesian Super-resolution.
	The method is described in the paper by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kangli/doc/papers/tipping03.pdf">Tipping and Bishop</a>.
	The work was done in partial fulfillment to obtain the Barchelor&#39;s degree in computer engineering.
	A full report on the project is found <a href="https://github.com/danchieta/projetoGurupi_texto/blob/master/projetoGurupi.pdf">here</a> (in Portuguese).</p>
	<p>This tool is able to obtain a high resolution image from a set of low resolution
	images from the same scene.
	Tests were made using only synthetic data as input, i.e. the low resolution 
	images were obtained by downsampling, warping and rotating a higher resolution
	image.</p>
	<p>The HR image has 152x104 and is shown below.</p>

	<p>A set of LR images with 38x26 pixels were generated from it.</p>
